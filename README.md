# AS-YelpClone
 Android Studio Yelp Clone Project


 *UPDATE*

 As of right now, I am currently stuck on building the RecyclerView for scrolling through the mapped data, as well mapping the data.
 I currently have the data being pulled correctly and the DataModel pulls the fields I plan on using afterwards.
 If you want to continue my project from here, feel free to, it is available for anyone to use.
 I just don't have the time right now as finals are approaching and project deadlines are coming up.
